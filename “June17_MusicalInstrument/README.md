Brief: In this assignment we had to a musical instrument. I included an ultrasonic sensor which changed the noise that was being made according to any object that was either brought further away (increases the pitch of the sound being made) or closer(decreases the pitch) to it. This was something new to me but I really enjoyed working with it. For the second resistor I went with a light sensitive photoresistor which was easier to manage. The most troubling part was making the schematic as I had to redo it.


Here are some photos:
