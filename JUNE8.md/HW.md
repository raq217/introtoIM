Here is what I have done for this assignment.

Brief; For this assignment we were told to experiment and play around with images. I wanted to come up with a code that would redraw any image that I wanted to. This interested me because it gives the computer its subjective thought on how to draw out the selected image in the way it seems best fit. After a lot of research I found an example of "pointlisim" which involves the redrawing of photos with dots. One of the challenges I faced was giving diversity to the size of the dots, I didn't want the points to just be large sized because it blurs out the phot, making it really hard to recognize. This video on youtube helpd me fix this problem and inspired me to make this; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70-4l7P6UB8. 

Here are the results:
