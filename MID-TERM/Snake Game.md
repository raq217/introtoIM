MID-TERM:
For our mid-term assignment we were told to make a game of our choice. I decided to recreate one of my favorite games of all time; Snake. Back home I still have an old Nokia that I use sometimes just to play the game as its just not the same on a computer, tablet or phone. My inspiration:

The only thing I didn't like about this verstion of Snake was the lack of colors in it due to the technology of the time. Which is why one of the aims in my game was to make it colorful instead of bland. I used vabriant colors such as pink and green to draw more attention and interest into the game. Also I added in a trail which would allow the user to draw objects with the movement of their snake, making it more fun and an art form. Here is a sneak peak.

There were a lot of challenges in making this game as I have no prior knowledge to coding.
1) I had a problem with assigning the arrow keys to control the snake as I would type in "UP ARROW" instead of just "UP". Even though this was a simple mistake it took some time getting around it.

2) At first I decided that the keys would determine the x and y values of the directions that the snake would follow. This was complicated, but I managed to find an easier way by using angles instead.

3) Making the ending board pop up to showcase the points and indicate that the game was lost/reset was not easy. At first it just kept on giving me a blank board without text. Again this was a simple mistake because I forgot to separate it in another void which was named void checkdead.
