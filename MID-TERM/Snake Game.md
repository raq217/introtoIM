MID-TERM:
For our mid-term assignment we were told to make a game of our choice. I decided to recreate one of my favorite games of all time; Snake. Back home I still have an old Nokia that I use sometimes just to play the game as its just not the same on a computer, tablet or phone. My inspiration:

The only thing I didn't like about this verstion of Snake was the lack of colors in it due to the technology of the time. Which is why one of the aims in my game was to make it colorful instead of bland. I used vabriant colors such as pink and green to draw more attention and interest into the game. Also I added in a trail which would allow the user to draw objects with the movement of their snake, making it more fun and an art form.
