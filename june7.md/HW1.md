Here is my first section for this assignment.

Brief: For this assignment I wanted to make generative text that interacts with the users mouse. For exmaple when the user clicks the word would change and in turn the new word would follow around with the mouse. This to me is a source of Interative Media as the user is interacting with what the creator has made. I decided to with Emirates in the UAE which meant that I had 7 different variables that the user could click on. This allows the user to draw whatever they like with the words they have.

One thing I would like to learn is how to be able to change the color of each individual word. This would make it more aritisitc and allow the user to create some form of digital presentation.
