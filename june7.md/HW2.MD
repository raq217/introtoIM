This is my second project.

Brief; For this assignment I wanted to play with sin and cos functions to draw out a shape autonomously. This involves translating and using floats to allow for the dots to randomly move on the canvas. As my previous projects I was inspired to make a new screensaver that does not require human interaction. One of my main challenges was using the "return" code because I have never used it for, it dictated the points at which the dots would move back to redraw the same shape it drew before. I wanted them translation to visually draw a vase. The end result was very interesing;
