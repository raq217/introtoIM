Here is my first assignment

Brief;
For the first assignment we had to make a portrait of ourselves on the application "Processing". This involved using code functions such as line(), rect(), arc(), eclipse(), fill() and noFill(). The main challenges was trying to get the arms and legs as symmetrical as possible. Some of the challenges I faced included; making the legs and arms the same length as possible. This took some time to get around as one arm would be longer than the other, but I managed to find the solution after looking at some videos and the website help provided.
