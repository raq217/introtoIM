This is my second assignment.

Breif;
For the second assignment we had to make a artistic animation. I aimed for a sort of screenscraver centered by a sphere. The main motion is the overlapping lines that vary in many different colors. This was a challenge because the lines would always be thicker than usual and at times conjoin to one another. Another difficulty I faced was the variables and matching them up with the different commands in Processing. This was mainly because of simple mistakes that involved spelling.
