Here is my third assignment;

Brief;
I wanted to experiment with ArrayLists for this assignment I looked at a morphing screensavers online and tried to replicate this. The main reason I decided to go with morphing is because I personally find it very satisfying when a shape easily trasnforms into another. The concept itself is quite simple, it is the change of one shape to another. One of the main problems that I faced was trying to add a third shape, it seemed to work perfectly for the first two shapes, however I wanted it to turn into a circle (which failed to execture). Hopefully I will be able do find a solution, which can make a great addition for my next assignment.I did not know how to fix the problem with the tip glitching, something I would like to go through in office hours.
