Brief:

For this assignment we had to incorporate the use of arduino and processing to make a single game. I went with the idea of remaking the well known game Flappy Bird. I was really interested to see how different the game would be instead of tapping on a screen and actually using your hand to control it. It was a lot harder than expected. One of the main challenges I faced in the process of making this game was the bounce pulse of the bird itself in correlation to the object being brought to the ultrasonic sensor. There were times where it would respond too quickly or too slowly. I managed to fix it my setting a the microseconds to centimeters. This video helped me understand the basics of the ultrasonic sensor detecing in cm.

Here is a short video of the game. The bird is moving up and down according to my hand being in front of the sensor. As I would place my hand in front of the sensor the bird will move down, when I take away my hand the bird will move back up.

Here is a photo of the very simple circuit.
