Pinball game

For my final project I would like to remake the game "Arkanoid" which involves the player moving a pad to keep the ball in constant with destroying the boxes. The reason why I want to remake this game is like the snake game, it was one of my favovrite games before the iPhone, I remember playing it quite a lot on my Blackberry. Both the Arduino and Processing will be used to make this game.

Arudino:
Used to generate the code to make sure that the potentiometer on the arduino board will respond to the code on processing.

Challenges:
One of the challenges I see is adjusting the potentiometer to the right sensitivity so that it is not too sensitive to control the moving platform for the ball to bounce on.


Processing:
Used to make the code/script for the actual game, including the aesthetics.

Challenges:
Making sure the gravity of the ball is set correctly along with the variables that depend on it.

Alternative project: Develop and a new version of the previous game with proper visuals like a plane and moving objects such as clouds etc.This will be using an ultrasonic sensor.
