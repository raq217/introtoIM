FINAL ASSIGNMENT BRIEF:

For my final project I wanted to make another game using the potentiometer as I have already used the ultrasonic sensor I wanted to try something new. Similar to my midterm project, I wanted to recreate the pinball brick breaker game that is most common with Blackberries. Also, I thought that this game would perfectly fit with the space theme that I wanted to go for. Before talking about the challenges I faced here are some short videos of the final creation:


Here we are in the fist level of the game in which the platform is as big as it can get. The ball is a little slower so that it makes it easier for the ueser to adjust to the game.

One of the middle levels.

One of the final levels in the game. The platform has become way smaller and the speed of the ball has slightly increased.

CHALLENGES:

1) Making sure that the blocks would disappear when coming in contact with the ball. This was quite difficult as I also had to bear in mind that the ball should be able to destroy the bricks when bouncing off the walls as well. However, I did notice some occasional glitches here and there.
2) I decided to use a lot of "floats" to define the rectangles and the ball which resulted into a lot of copying and pasting (not too hard, just frustrating).
3)Surprsingly the set up of the potentiometer wasn't as hard as expected. Working with the ultrasonic sensor was a lot harder because it depended on many factors such as the brightness which had to be controlled through Arduino. 

To conclude, I learnt a couple of new things while making this game such as how to reduce the chance of glitches and bugs, making sure objects are deleted and changing the speed of different variables that are dependent on others.
