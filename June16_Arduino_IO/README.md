Brief: For this assignment we had to use the Arduino to great an analog and digital sensor which would control two different LEDs. This was a little bit challenging as I have never done two LEDs at one before. Working through it, I decided that I wanted to use a push button switch which would control which LED would turn on, so when pressing it both LEDs would switch on but when releasing only one LED would remain on. I wanted to do this as you could play around with it and tune it to a beat or any sound. For the second sensor I used the potentiometer which controled the blue LEDs flicker. If the potentiometer was on a low voltage then the blue LED would blink/flicker slower and as you increase the voltage it blinks faster until you reach the max potential in which it would just stay on.

Here is the complete circuit (holding switch to light up both LEDs):

Using the push button to switch up which LED would light up. You can control the speed at which it changes according to how many times you press it:
