Brief: For this assignment we had to use the Arduino to great an analog and digital sensor which would control two different LEDs. This was a little bit challenging as I have never done two LEDs at one before. Working through it, I decided that I wanted to use a push button switch which would control which LED would turn on, so when pressing it both LEDs would switch on but when releasing only one LED would remain on. I wanted to do this as you could play around with it and tune it to a beat or any sound. For the second sensor I used the potentiometer which controled the blue LEDs flicker. If the potentiometer was on a low voltage then the blue LED would blink/flicker slower and as you increase the voltage it blinks faster until you reach the max potential in which it would just stay on.
