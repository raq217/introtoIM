Here is my first assignment

Brief;
For the first assignment we had to make a portrait of ourselves on the application "Processing". This involved using code functions such as line(), rect(), arc(), eclipse(), fill() and noFill(). The main challenges was trying to get the arms and legs as symmetrical as possible.
